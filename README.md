#### 🔑 **Access Code Security System**
The platform implements a robust access code security system to ensure only authorized students can access tests:

- **Time-Based Access Codes**: Automatically generated 5-digit codes that change every hour
- **Manual Refresh Capability**: Instructors can instantly generate new codes when needed
- **Real-Time Validation**: Access codes are validated every 3 seconds during test sessions
- **Immediate Lockout**: Students are instantly locked out when access codes change or expire
- **Cross-Device Security**: Code changes are enforced across all devices and browser sessions

**How it Works:**
1. Instructors view the current access code in the admin dashboard
2. Students must enter the valid access code before starting any test
3. During the test, the system checks every 3 seconds if the access code is still valid
4. If the instructor refreshes the code or it expires, students are immediately locked out
5. Students must re-enter the new access code to continue testing

This ensures maximum security and prevents unauthorized access, even if students share codes or leave tests unattended.
